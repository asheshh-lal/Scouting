## Technical Overview of the FastAPI Application for Player Analysis

### Introduction

This FastAPI application analyzes and compares football players using a comprehensive dataset. It leverages various libraries, including a Generative AI model from Google, to provide an interactive web interface for exploring player statistics and similarities. The application generates radar charts and detailed player descriptions, enhancing the user experience with visual and textual insights.

### Data

The application initializes its database by uploading data from a CSV file during startup. This file contains detailed player statistics, which are essential for the analysis. The application ensures the database is refreshed with the latest data every time the application starts and  `asyncio.Lock()` guarantees exclusive access to the database during this process, preventing conflicts and ensuring data integrity.

### Player Listing and Submission

The application's main endpoint (`/`) displays a list of distinct player names from the database, which users can select and submit. The `get_players` function queries the database for unique player names and passes them to the template for rendering. The `submit_player` function then retrieves the selected player's data and finds similar players using a clustering algorithm.

### Finding Similar Players

The `find_similar_players` function is the core of the player comparison feature. It reads the entire dataset, normalizes specific performance metrics, and clusters players based on their positions and other attributes. The cosine similarity measure is used to rank these similar players, ensuring the most comparable players are presented to the user.

### Generating Radar Charts

The `generate_radar_charts` function creates radar charts for each similar player, visualizing their performance metrics. It selects relevant parameters based on the player's position and normalizes the statistics before generating the charts, which are saved as PNG files in the static directory.

### Detailed Player Descriptions

The application integrates with Google's Generative AI models to provide detailed player descriptions. The `fetch_gemini_results` function generates prompts based on selected player statistics and fetches the narrative responses, which are formatted as HTML using the markdown2 library.

### Endpoint for Viewing Descriptions

The `/view-description` endpoint allows users to request detailed descriptions for a selected player and a comparison player. It fetches the relevant data from the database and generates a descriptive narrative using the AI model, returning the response as JSON.

### Conclusion
This FastAPI application combines data analysis, Machine learning concepts and LLM tools to deliver a comprehensive platform for player analysis. It offers an interactive experience with visual aids and detailed textual insights, enhancing users' understanding of player performance and similarities.
